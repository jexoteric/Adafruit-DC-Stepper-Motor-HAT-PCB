# Raspberry Pi Zero DC and Stepper motor hat
Creating a more compact version of the Adafruit DC Stepper motor hat, with the goal of 100% compatability. The only real changes are there is no prototyping area, no breakouts of the pi pins, and fewer 3v3, 5v, and GND pins.


Programming with this board should be 100% identical to programming with the original Adafruit design linked below.
